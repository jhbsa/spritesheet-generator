example usage for sb-icons (or any other folder with images to be put in a sprite sheet)
assuming source image folder is sb-icons and all icons are the same size (allowing me to optimize css)
./generate.sh -n sb-icons -w 150 -e 155

If I don't put both w & e(height), then css will have size in each image class. (which is ok, so long as that's intended.)
